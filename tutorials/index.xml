So I&amp;rsquo;m mostly Python guy, but I&amp;rsquo;ve recently applied for a Junior Java Developer job. I have some commercial experience with it (more than Python, to be honest) but my skills got rusty, so I decided to create a little project to sharpen them. It took me about a week to come up with The Pastinator - a Pastebin-like app written in Angular/Spring Boot.
Everything you need is in video description.</description></item><item><title>Securing Apache on Ubuntu 18.04 with a Let's Encrypt TLS certificate</title><link>/tutorials/apache-tls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2020 14:19:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/apache-tls/</guid><description>Literally every modern site implements TLS certificate. Why don&amp;rsquo;t we do the same? We will use a free certificate issued by Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt.
I assume that you have Ubuntu and Apache up. We will start with issuing the cert. Let&amp;rsquo;s go!
Issuing the certificate Start with installing Certbot. It will add all requirements for us:
sudo apt install certbot
Issue the cert. I use example.com for an example. Change it for your domain&amp;rsquo;s name:</description></item><item><title>Mange a domain with Domain.com and DigitalOcean</title><link>/tutorials/digitalocean-domain/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 20:21:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/digitalocean-domain/</guid><description>Most of the developers sooner or later will have to buy a domain for one of their projects, let it be hobby or commercial. I had this problem recently and most solutions that I&amp;rsquo;ve found were lacking, so I thought of this tutorial.
I assume that you have already bought a domain at Domain.com and have created a droplet on DigitalOcean. Let&amp;rsquo;s start, shall we?
DigitalOcean&amp;rsquo;s end On your project&amp;rsquo;s page, select Add a domain frtom a dropdown menu:</description></item><item><title>Create Reddit upvoter using Python and PRAW</title><link>/tutorials/reddit-upvoter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2020 16:05:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/reddit-upvoter/</guid><description>Welcome to another tutorial of mine! Be sure to check the previous ones here. In this one, I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover a script that upvotes every new submission and comment from a given subreddit. Please, don&amp;rsquo;t try to run it in reverse and downvote all the things. Please&amp;hellip;
I assume that you have Python installed on your system. The tutorial targets Windows 10 with Powershell.
Registering the application In order to use PRAW, we need to register our script first.</description></item><item><title>Host a Flask app using Apache and mod_wsgi</title><link>/tutorials/apache-wsgi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2020 13:37:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/apache-wsgi/</guid><description>Now that dust has settled after Youtube Thumbnail Downloader tutorial, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a new thing. When you run a Flask developement server, it tells you that it isn&amp;rsquo;t suited for prodution:
WARNING: This is a developlment server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
Fair point. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tested for security and whatnot. There are a few alternatives, most notably Nginx and Apache. I go for the latter.</description></item><item><title>Create your own Youtube Thumbnail Downloader in Python</title><link>/tutorials/youtube-thumbnail-downloader/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2020 11:36:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/youtube-thumbnail-downloader/</guid><description>The idea is pretty simple. Given the URL to a Youtube video, the script spews out it&amp;rsquo;s thumbnail. See this lovely image? It would make for a perfect wallpaper and I wrote a script that does just that.
How would Python render it possible, you&amp;rsquo;d ask? By working hand-in-hand with Youtube API, of course! I should seriously reconsider becoming a clown. I have a hunch that it would come as natural to me.</description></item></channel></rss>
