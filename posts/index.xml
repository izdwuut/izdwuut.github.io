I&amp;rsquo;ve recently moved my blog to Medium. From now on, I treat this one as a legacy project. It may be still useful to some of you, but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to update it any more.
Thanks for stepping in!</description></item><item><title>IS THIS THING RECORD O hi there!</title><link>/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2018 13:26:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>Hello world! I&amp;rsquo;m Bartosz. Now that I have your attention, why don&amp;rsquo;t you follow this inconspicuous and harmless link and click OK in every window that appear on your screen? Much obliged.
This is it! My much awaited blog. Admit it, you was looking forward to check out what nonsensical thoughts I managed to came up with. Wait until you see my prime time commercials. I think (I hope) that it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that I&amp;rsquo;m going to dedicate this place to some programming-related stuff.</description></item></channel></rss>
