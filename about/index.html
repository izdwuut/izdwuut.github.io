There ought to be a <a href=https://www.w3.org/>W3C</a>-standardized way to open several links in one click so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to explicitily say that it was a cliché Skyrim reference. Every single night I silently weep because I find no real interest in video games as of lately. Actually that&rsquo;s mostly because I feel deep solitude caused by a gargantuic hole in my heart which is unlikely to get fixed in the foreseeable future. But yeah, I miss games.</p><p>Phew. Not so big of a burden when you decide to finally throw it out. Katharsis of sorts.</p><p>Oh, and I was also an avid black metal fan but I discovered that it made my acne go haywire. Ever heard about plants growing stronger while exposed to some classical tunes? It surely was that, I&rsquo;m certain. The fact that I still look like a Minesweeper ad after withdrawing it is the whole different story and there is no corellation whatsoever. Now I&rsquo;m more into pop or anything with over 30 millions views on YT in particular. I feel that it makes me a whole lot saner. But hey, let me know if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt5_hI3ySCw">Mgła</a> has released any new odiferous miasma so I can book some ritual bloodletting.</p><p>Fast-forward to today, I&rsquo;m a programmer. Not too big of a personal growth now, is it? Anyhow, I&rsquo;m not some sort of a programming guru and I hope that I don&rsquo;t act like one. I have just attained some knowledge surplus and I&rsquo;d love to share it with you. Privately I mostly write open-source code that I host on <a href=https://github.com/izdwuut>GitHub</a>. I tremendously enjoy coding and I hope that you&rsquo;d find it fun, too. At the end of the day I dedicate the biggest part of my life (on a par with sleep. Sleep is good) to it and it makes me happy to do what I love and be able to share my passion with others. Simple as that. I also happen improve apps by reporting <a href=/bugs/>bugs</a> and proposing new features.</p><p>You can reach out to me through the following channels:</p><ul><li><a href=mailto:izdwuut@gmail.com>E-mail</a>.</li><li>Carrier pigeon, although packet loss rate is relatively high.</li></ul></div><footer class=post-footer></footer><div class=cd>&#x1F4BF;</div></article></main><footer class=footer><span>Made with <i style=color:red class="fas fa-heart"></i>by
