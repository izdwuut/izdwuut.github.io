I had this problem recently and most solutions that I&amp;rsquo;ve found were lacking, so I thought of this tutorial.
I assume that you have already bought a domain at Domain.com and have created a droplet on DigitalOcean. Let&amp;rsquo;s start, shall we?
DigitalOcean&amp;rsquo;s end On your project&amp;rsquo;s page, select Add a domain frtom a dropdown menu:</description></item><item><title>Create Reddit upvoter using Python and PRAW</title><link>/tutorials/reddit-upvoter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2020 16:05:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/reddit-upvoter/</guid><description>Welcome to another tutorial of mine! Be sure to check the previous ones here. In this one, I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover a script that upvotes every new submission and comment from a given subreddit. Please, don&amp;rsquo;t try to run it in reverse and downvote all the things. Please&amp;hellip;
I assume that you have Python installed on your system. The tutorial targets Windows 10 with Powershell.
Registering the application In order to use PRAW, we need to register our script first.</description></item><item><title>Host a Flask app using Apache and mod_wsgi</title><link>/tutorials/apache-wsgi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2020 13:37:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/apache-wsgi/</guid><description>Now that dust has settled after Youtube Thumbnail Downloader tutorial, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a new thing. When you run a Flask developement server, it tells you that it isn&amp;rsquo;t suited for prodution:
WARNING: This is a developlment server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
Fair point. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tested for security and whatnot. There are a few alternatives, most notably Nginx and Apache. I go for the latter.</description></item><item><title>Create your own Youtube Thumbnail Downloader in Python</title><link>/tutorials/youtube-thumbnail-downloader/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2020 11:36:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/youtube-thumbnail-downloader/</guid><description>The idea is pretty simple. Given the URL to a Youtube video, the script spews out it&amp;rsquo;s thumbnail. See this lovely image? It would make for a perfect wallpaper and I wrote a script that does just that.
How would Python render it possible, you&amp;rsquo;d ask? By working hand-in-hand with Youtube API, of course! I should seriously reconsider becoming a clown. I have a hunch that it would come as natural to me.</description></item><item><title>Bugs and features</title><link>/bugs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2018 12:32:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>/bugs/</guid><description>I enjoy improving applications. I do my best to report issues and propose improvements as soon as I notice them. Sometimes I find it difficult because there might be no bug tracker or it may be so obscure that I can&amp;rsquo;t help but flee. Because my reports are scattered all over various places, I decided to collect them in here.</description></item><item><title>Reviews</title><link>/reviews/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2018 09:05:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>/reviews/</guid><description>Video games are cool, aren&amp;rsquo;t they? Once I was under an impression that I&amp;rsquo;m able to finish every single item on my backlog. Suprisingly I&amp;rsquo;m not. But it was great quest nonetheless! I signed for reviewing every title that I will manage to finish. I was mostly publishing my reviews on Steam, thanks to it&amp;rsquo;s built-in feature. For games that I didn&amp;rsquo;t own on that platform, I published them on Metacritic.</description></item><item><title>IS THIS THING RECORD O hi there!</title><link>/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2018 13:26:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>Hello world! I&amp;rsquo;m Bartosz. Now that I have your attention, why don&amp;rsquo;t you follow this inconspicuous and harmless link and click OK in every window that appear on your screen? Much obliged.
This is it! My much awaited blog. Admit it, you was looking forward to check out what nonsensical thoughts I managed to came up with. Wait until you see my prime time commercials. I think (I hope) that it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that I&amp;rsquo;m going to dedicate this place to some programming-related stuff.</description></item><item><title>Exceedingly entertaining piece of information about my humble and awe-inspiring persona</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2018 13:11:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>I was a gamer once. There ought to be a W3C-standardized way to open several links in one click so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to explicitily say that it was a cliché Skyrim reference. Every single night I silently weep because I find no real interest in video games as of lately. Actually that&amp;rsquo;s mostly because I feel deep solitude caused by a gargantuic hole in my heart which is unlikely to get fixed in the foreseeable future.</description></item></channel></rss>
