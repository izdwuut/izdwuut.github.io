Okay. So I'm mostly Python guy, but I've recently applied for a Junior Java Developer job. I have some commercial experience with it (more than Python, to be honest) but my skills got rusty, so I decided to create a little project to sharpen them. It took me about a week to come up with The Pastinator - a Pastebin-like app written in Angular/Spring Boot.

Everything you need is in video description. I see no point in repeating myself. It's about 3 hours long, so prepare for a ride. Enjoy!
